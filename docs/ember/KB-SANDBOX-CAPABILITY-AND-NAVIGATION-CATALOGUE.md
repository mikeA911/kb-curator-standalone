# KB Sandbox Capability and Navigation Catalogue

**Purpose:** Living product-navigation knowledge for Ember, release documentation, future application discovery, and a possible KB Sandbox MCP interface  
**Status:** Initial baseline — expand as workflows are verified  
**Application version:** 0.1.0  
**Last code verification:** 2026-09-04  

## How this document is used

This catalogue records what users can accomplish in KB Sandbox, where each workflow begins, which access rules apply, and how Ember should guide the user. It is committed with the application and should be updated in the same change as a material user-visible workflow.

This is not a changelog. Release notes should briefly describe what changed and link to the affected catalogue entry. This document retains the durable, current description of the workflow.

Each capability is described using the following fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Intent | What the user is trying to accomplish |
| Users and authority | Who may see or use the capability |
| Prerequisites | Required identity, membership, role, content, or state |
| Start | Stable page from which the workflow begins |
| Navigation | Shortest supported UI sequence |
| Outcome | What the user should expect to see or create |
| Ember guidance | What Ember may explain, link to, or perform |
| Boundaries | Important restrictions, approvals, side effects, and known limitations |
| Exposure | Current or possible AI/MCP classification |
| Verification | Evidence and date supporting the entry |

## Release-note convention

A release note should be short and change-oriented:

```text
### <User-visible capability>

<What changed and why it matters to the user.>

- Available to: <roles or project relationship>
- Start at: <stable route>
- Ember: <new explanation, navigation, or action behavior>
- Guide: <link to the affected catalogue heading>
```

Example:

```text
### Project-scoped Assistant conversations

Members can now ask Ember about a project and receive answers grounded in that project's authorized sources and platform guidance.

- Available to: authorized project members
- Start at: `/projects/[id]`
- Ember: explains missing prerequisites and offers the project-specific Assistant entry point
- Guide: Project workspace → Ask Ember about a project
```

Do not copy the entire workflow into every release note. Update the workflow here, then use the release note to identify the change.

## Navigation map

## 1. Sign in

### Access the Workbench

- **Intent:** Sign in and continue work under the correct user identity and role.
- **Users and authority:** A registered user with valid credentials.
- **Prerequisites:** An account that is permitted to sign in.
- **Start:** `/login`
- **Navigation:** Enter credentials → submit → `/dashboard`.
- **Outcome:** The Workbench opens with navigation and content appropriate to the user's platform role and project memberships.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may direct a signed-out user to `/login`. Ember must not request, repeat, retain, or transmit the user's password or API keys.
- **Boundaries:** Authentication does not grant access to every project. Project membership and content visibility continue to apply after sign-in.
- **Exposure:** UI guidance only; prohibited from agent credential handling.
- **Verification:** Login form redirects successful authentication to `/dashboard`; code verified 2026-08-28.

## 2. Workbench

### Review current activity and navigate to work

- **Intent:** Understand what exists, what needs attention, and where to continue.
- **Users and authority:** Admin and curator. A signed-in `consultant` (an ordinary Project member) instead lands on the Ember-first home described in the next entry -- this summary view is no longer what that role sees at `/dashboard`.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in admin or curator session.
- **Start:** `/dashboard`
- **Navigation:** Use the summary cards for Projects, Knowledge, Evaluations, Agents, or Trending; use **Sources & Curation** to open `/upload`.
- **Outcome:** A role-aware summary of accessible work and direct links to the corresponding areas.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may explain the cards and provide stable links. It should mention that counts and attention items depend on access and role.
- **Boundaries:** Wiki review queues and governance attention items are limited to curator/admin users. Shared links and personal notes are shown only to eligible signed-in users. Dashboard totals do not authorize access to an underlying item.
- **Exposure:** Ember-readable; candidate for external MCP read access as a caller-scoped summary.
- **Verification:** `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`; code verified 2026-08-30 (role branch added).

### Ember-first home (ordinary members)

- **Intent:** Give an ordinary Project member (platform role `consultant`) a working surface centered on Ember rather than platform-wide statistics.
- **Users and authority:** Platform role `consultant` only. Admin and curator continue to see the standard Workbench summary described above.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in session.
- **Start:** `/dashboard`
- **Navigation:** Choose a Project from the selector (only the user's own active memberships appear, plus "General platform guidance") → **Ask Ember**. The choice is reflected in the page URL (`?ember=<projectId>`) so it survives a reload, and shows as a persistent "Using: <Project>" chip.
- **Outcome:** An embedded, Project-bound (or general) Ember conversation opens inline, alongside the user's recent conversations and a secondary **Explore workspace →** link to `/projects` for anyone who wants the full Workbench.
- **Ember guidance:** Same rules as any other project-bound or general conversation -- see "Work inside a project" below.
- **Boundaries:** Switching the Project selector always starts a fresh embedded conversation instance -- no retrieved evidence, citations, or chat history carry over from whatever Project was previously selected. The selector only ever lists the viewer's own active memberships.
- **Exposure:** UI surface only, not a distinct MCP concept -- the underlying Ember conversation follows the same project-binding rules as everywhere else.
- **Verification:** `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/EmberHome.tsx`; code verified 2026-08-30. Live-verified as a `consultant`-role account: selector persists via the URL, scope chip updates, the embedded panel remounts cleanly (no leaked state) on every Project switch; `admin`/`curator` accounts confirmed unaffected.

### Add a shared link

- **Intent:** Recommend external material for other Workbench users to examine.
- **Users and authority:** Active signed-in, non-anonymous users; admin may remove entries.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in session; optional project membership when associating a link with a project.
- **Start:** `/dashboard` or `/trending/new`
- **Navigation:** Find the shared-links area → add the title, URL, description, tags, and optional authorized project → submit.
- **Outcome:** A Trending/shared-link entry, explicitly treated as a recommendation rather than approved knowledge.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may explain the distinction between external material and approved Wiki knowledge and navigate to the submission page.
- **Boundaries:** Submission is not publication as trusted knowledge. Promotion to Wiki follows a separate review workflow.
- **Exposure:** Candidate for MCP draft/action after confirmation; moderation remains authority-gated.
- **Verification:** Dashboard and Trending components; code verified 2026-08-28.

## 3. Projects

### Find or create a project

- **Intent:** Organize a bounded body of work with its own objective, members, sources, approvals, workstreams, assessments, and evidence.
- **Users and authority:** Signed-in users may see projects permitted by policy and create a project. Subsequent management depends on project relationship and authority.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in session.
- **Start:** `/projects`
- **Navigation:** Open **Projects** ("My Projects" -- genuinely scoped to the user's own active memberships for every platform role, including admin) → select an accessible project, or choose **New project** → `/projects/new`. Admin/curator additionally see a **View Organization Portfolio →** link to `/projects/portfolio` (next entry).
- **Outcome:** An existing project workspace opens, or the user begins the project-creation workflow.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may list accessible projects, explain project types, navigate to `/projects` or a project derived from the authorized current context, and help create a project only through supported bounded tools.
- **Boundaries:** A platform role alone must not be represented as customer-project authorization. Ember should identify membership or authority gaps before proposing restricted actions. As of 2026-08-30, platform admin no longer sees every Project on `/projects` merely by role -- that previously relied on an RLS bypass and has been fixed; org-wide visibility for admin/curator now lives only in the safe-metadata Organization Portfolio below.
- **Exposure:** Ember-readable and partly Ember-actionable; strong candidate for caller-scoped MCP read access. Creation or change requires identity, validation, and confirmation.
- **Verification:** `/projects`, `/projects/new`, project membership and governance routes; code verified 2026-08-30.

### Browse and categorize My Projects

- **Intent:** Find a Project faster in a growing list by browsing it grouped into named categories instead of one flat grid.
- **Users and authority:** Any signed-in user, scoped to their own active memberships (same as "Find or create a project" above). Changing a Project's own category is owner/curator/admin only.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in session; at least one active Project membership to see any groups.
- **Start:** `/projects`
- **Navigation:** Projects page -- Projects now render under section headings (Sandz / Foundation / Showcases / Builder Lab / Templates / Legacy/Test / Archived / Others), each with a count; empty sections are hidden. To change a Project's own category, open it and use the selector next to its project type near the top of `/projects/[id]`.
- **Outcome:** The same set of Projects the user could always see, organized into fewer, labeled groups instead of one long grid.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this -- it is a page-level display only. If asked to categorize or find a Project by type, point the user to `/projects` rather than attempting to enumerate or sort Projects conversationally.
- **Boundaries:** This is a separate axis from `project_type` (learning/experiment/consulting/transformation/knowledge) -- the two do not line up 1:1, so never explain a Project's category by restating its type. A brand-new Project always starts in "Others" until its owner/curator classifies it.
- **Exposure:** UI-only; not Ember-actionable.
- **Verification:** `src/app/(app)/projects/page.tsx`, `src/components/projects/ProjectCategorySelector.tsx`, `src/lib/workbench/projects.ts` (`updateProjectPortfolioCategory`), `supabase/migrations/20260904120001_project_portfolio_category.sql` + `..._v2.sql`; code verified 2026-09-04. Live-verified as a platform admin: `/projects` renders grouped sections with correct counts, and the per-project selector saves and persists after reload.

### View the organization portfolio (admin/curator)

- **Intent:** Give platform admin/curator a safe, organization-wide view of every Project without granting content access merely by platform role.
- **Users and authority:** Admin and curator only; any other role is redirected to `/projects`.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in admin or curator session.
- **Start:** `/projects/portfolio` (linked from `/projects` for eligible roles)
- **Navigation:** Projects → **View Organization Portfolio →**.
- **Outcome:** A table of every Project's safe metadata -- name, type, status, owner, active member count, attached-knowledge-base count, authority-gap and unpublished-draft indicators, last updated. As of 2026-09-01, the row action is role-dependent, not just membership-dependent: an admin viewer always sees "Open workspace" (`is_project_member`'s own `is_admin` bypass already grants them the underlying content regardless of membership -- the table was previously hiding a link they could use anyway). A non-member curator, who has no such bypass, instead sees a one-click "Request membership" button that sends a `project_notes` note to the Project owner. A Project the viewer is an active member of still links straight through, same as before.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this view; if asked for an organization-wide summary, it should point an eligible user here rather than attempting to enumerate Projects itself.
- **Boundaries:** This view never exposes source titles, snippets, chat history, or artifacts -- only counts and dates computed from a narrow, explicitly safe query (never a service-role content query with UI-side hiding). It is not a bypass into any Project's private content for a curator -- a non-member curator still cannot open the workspace, only request access to it.
- **Exposure:** Not Ember-actionable; a candidate for a future caller-scoped MCP summary limited to the same safe fields.
- **Verification:** `src/app/(app)/projects/portfolio/page.tsx`, `src/lib/projects/portfolio.ts`, `src/components/projects/OrganizationPortfolio.tsx`, `src/components/projects/RequestMembershipButton.tsx`, `src/app/actions/project-notes.ts` (`requestProjectMembershipAction`), `supabase/migrations/20260901120001_project_notes_request_membership.sql`; code verified 2026-08-30, admin-bypass and request-membership behavior verified 2026-09-01. Live-verified with `admin`/`curator` test accounts against real seed data: an admin non-member of a Project still gets "Open workspace" and a fully rendered workspace on click; a non-member curator's "Request membership" click inserts exactly one open `project_notes` row addressed to the owner, survives a page reload as "Request sent" with no way to re-click, and a second click (or a reload-then-click) does not insert a duplicate.

### Work inside a project

- **Intent:** Use project-specific sources and knowledge while preserving access boundaries and provenance.
- **Users and authority:** Authorized project owner or member; individual actions may require a project role or named approval authority.
- **Prerequisites:** Access to the selected project.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]`
- **Navigation:** Projects → select project → choose the relevant workstream, assessment, notes, members, access, governance, publication, or Ember action.
- **Outcome:** Work remains bound to the selected project and its approved evidence.
- **Ember guidance:** When entered through **Ask Assistant about this project**, Ember should preserve the project binding, search only authorized project knowledge plus approved platform guidance, and label citations accordingly. It also gains `list_project_members` and `send_project_note` in this bound state -- see the dedicated entry below.
- **Boundaries:** General unbound chat must not retrieve project-private evidence merely because the user happens to be a project member. Consequential decisions remain human- or authority-approved. As of 2026-08-29, a project or resource classified above the selected model's approved AI-processing sensitivity blocks the turn before any content reaches that model -- Ember explains the block and names the sensitivity tier rather than silently refusing or answering without the restricted evidence.
- **Exposure:** Ember-readable/actionable within the project binding; MCP access must preserve caller identity, project membership, and approval rules.
- **Verification:** Project routes and previously live-verified project-bound retrieval behavior; reviewed 2026-08-29.

### Create a workstream on a project

- **Intent:** Start a new structured body of work (a Workstream) inside an existing Project.
- **Users and authority:** Project owner or curator, or a platform admin -- a plain Project member (e.g. `consultant` Project role) cannot do this, even if their *platform* role is `curator` or `admin` (Project role and platform role are independent; the check is on the Project-scoped role, not the platform one).
- **Prerequisites:** Active membership in the Project with `owner` or `curator` Project role, or platform `admin`.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]`
- **Navigation:** Project page → the **New Workstream** link (only rendered for an authorized viewer -- it does not appear at all for a plain member) → `/projects/[id]/workstreams/new`.
- **Outcome:** A new draft Workstream on the Project.
- **Ember guidance:** `create_workstream` fails for a caller whose Project role is `consultant` or `viewer`. If you don't know the caller's Project role, check with `list_project_members` before offering this as a ready action. If it fails or isn't available, tell the user their *Project* role (not platform role) needs to be `owner` or `curator`, and that the Project's owner **or curator** can change that on the Members page (`/projects/[id]/members`) -- do not say "click New Workstream" to someone who can't see that link.
- **Boundaries:** Never conflate platform role (`profiles.role`: consultant/curator/admin) with Project role (`project_members.role`: owner/curator/consultant/viewer) -- a platform curator/admin is not automatically a Project curator on any given Project unless separately made a member with that Project role.
- **Exposure:** Ember-actionable (`create_workstream`) and UI (`New Workstream` link), both gated identically.
- **Verification:** `src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/page.tsx` (`canCurateWorkstreams`), `src/lib/workbench/workstreams.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260810120001_project_members.sql` (`can_curate_project`); code verified 2026-08-31. Added after a live test (`docs/test-reports/2026-08-31-orderlunch-builder-journey.md`, OL-002/OL-003) found Ember offering this action to an unauthorized caller and then, after the resulting failure, giving recovery guidance that named a control the caller couldn't actually see.

### Explore how this Project connects to others (read-only)

- **Intent:** See which other Projects share a knowledge base with the current one, purely through existing attachments -- not a new hierarchy or Organization entity.
- **Users and authority:** Any active member of the current Project; a connected Project only appears if the viewer can also see it.
- **Prerequisites:** Active membership in the Project being viewed.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]` (Organization Explorer section)
- **Navigation:** Project page → Organization Explorer → each attached knowledge base lists its sources and any other Project also attached to it, one level deep.
- **Outcome:** A read-only, navigation-only tree. Selecting a connected Project opens its own full, independent workspace -- it does not inherit the current Project's members, roles, or access grants (confirmed live: a member's role and business function differ between the root and a connected Project).
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this; it is a page-level visualization only.
- **Boundaries:** No move/attach/detach/rename/delete action exists here. Restricted branches are omitted, never shown as locked placeholders. Never presented as a technical parent/child or Organization concept. Cycles (a Project reachable through two shared knowledge bases) collapse into one expanded node and a reference, never recursive rendering.
- **Exposure:** Not Ember-actionable; page-level only.
- **Verification:** `src/lib/projects/explorer.ts`, `src/components/projects/OrganizationExplorer.tsx`; code verified 2026-08-30.

### Add or invite a member to a Project

- **Intent:** Bring an existing KB Sandbox user onto a Project, or -- as of 2026-09-04 -- create a brand-new account for someone who has never used KB Sandbox and add them in one step. Confirmed model: a Project's curator is usually the department head or trusted assistant actually running that team's work, so this is deliberately not owner-only.
- **Users and authority:** The Project's **owner or curator**, or a platform admin. A plain member/consultant Project role cannot reach this page at all. **Creating a brand-new account is capped by who is doing it**: a platform admin can create an account at any platform role (member/consultant/curator/admin); a Project owner or curator who is *not* a platform admin can only create an account at platform role `member` or `consultant` -- **a curator can never create a new curator or admin account**, no matter what role they try to select. This cap is enforced in application code, not just the database, because minting an account uses a privileged path that bypasses ordinary row-level security.
- **Prerequisites:** Active `owner` or `curator` Project role, or platform `admin`. Self-serve registration is removed platform-wide -- there is no other way for a genuinely new person to get an account.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]/members`
- **Navigation:** Project page → **Members** link (visible only to an authorized viewer) → enter the person's email and pick a Project role → **Add**. If no account exists for that email, an inline "No account for `<email>` yet" panel appears (visible to an authorized viewer only) offering to create one and add them in the same step -- fill in a password (or use the pre-filled one), pick a capped platform role, and **Create & add**. The generated password is shown once in a confirmation banner; there is no email delivery in this environment, so it must be handed to the new person directly (Slack, in person, etc.).
- **Outcome:** The person becomes an active Project member at the chosen Project role. For a newly created account, they also get a real KB Sandbox login at the platform role the inviter chose (capped as above).
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this -- it is a UI-only workflow. If a user asks Ember to "add" or "invite" someone to a Project, direct them here (or to `/projects/[id]` → Members section for their own Project) rather than attempting it conversationally. If the user asks whether a curator can make someone else a curator or admin, the answer is **no** -- only a platform admin can create a curator or admin account; a curator inviting a genuinely new person can only give them `member` or `consultant`. Do not say a curator can promote someone to owner, either -- that stays owner/admin-only (see "Create a workstream on a project" for the same owner/curator distinction rule).
- **Boundaries:** Never conflate this with the read-only Member Directory (next entry) -- that page cannot add anyone. Never imply the created account is usable before the inviter has actually communicated the password to the new person. Never state or imply a curator-created account could be given curator/admin platform role -- that path is blocked in code even if someone tries.
- **Exposure:** UI-only; not Ember-actionable.
- **Verification:** `src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/members/page.tsx`, `src/components/projects/MembersManager.tsx`, `src/lib/workbench/projects.ts` (`addProjectMember`, `createAndAddProjectMember`), `supabase/migrations/20260903100001_curator_manages_project_members.sql` (`project_members_curate` RLS); code verified 2026-09-04. Live-verified as a non-admin curator persona on a real, Sandz-visible Project: invited an existing member, created a brand-new account capped to `member`/`consultant` (the platform-role selector never offered curator/admin), and confirmed the owner's own row and the `owner` role option stayed completely out of reach.

### See a Project's member directory and send a note

- **Intent:** See who is actively working on a Project and send one of them an addressed note, without needing owner/admin management access.
- **Users and authority:** Any active member of the Project. Distinct from the owner/curator/admin-only Members management page (`/projects/[id]/members`), which adds/removes members and changes roles -- as of 2026-09-03, a Project **curator** (department head running their own team's Project) can manage membership too, not just the owner, including creating an account for someone brand-new (capped to platform role `member`/`consultant`).
- **Prerequisites:** Active membership in the Project.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]` (Members section)
- **Navigation:** Project page → Members section lists every active member with role and business function → **Send note** on any member other than yourself → prefilled note form at `/projects/[id]/notes`.
- **Outcome:** A compact, read-only roster, plus an addressed Project Note (reusing the existing Project Notes feature -- not a new messaging channel) once sent.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember can answer the same "who's on this project" questions conversationally -- see the next entry.
- **Boundaries:** Only active members appear; a removed member disappears immediately and cannot be addressed. The directory never lists members of a different Project. Not shown to a non-member viewing a published/public Project.
- **Exposure:** UI-only; the equivalent Ember-actionable path is `list_project_members`/`send_project_note` below.
- **Verification:** `src/components/projects/MemberDirectory.tsx`, `src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/notes/page.tsx`; code verified 2026-08-30.

### Ask Ember who's on a Project, or have Ember send a note

- **Intent:** Answer "who's working on this?", "who owns it?", "who handles a specific approval?", or "can I send someone a note?" conversationally, inside a Project-bound Ember conversation.
- **Users and authority:** Any active member, within a conversation already bound to that Project.
- **Prerequisites:** The conversation must have a server-resolved Project binding (opened via **Ask Ember about this Project**, or a Project chosen on the Ember-first home). A general, unbound conversation has neither tool available and cannot enumerate any Project's roster.
- **Start:** Any project-bound Ember conversation.
- **Navigation:** Ask Ember directly -- no page navigation involved.
- **Outcome:** Ember calls `list_project_members` (no Project ID accepted from the model; it is always the conversation's own server-resolved binding) and answers with each active member's role, business function, and any approval responsibility already visible to the caller -- never platform-wide roles, other Projects' memberships, or evidence-access grants. If asked to send a note, Ember first calls `list_project_members` to find the exact recipient, states the exact recipient/subject/body, and waits for the user's explicit confirmation before calling `send_project_note`.
- **Ember guidance:** Fetch fresh every time -- never guess from earlier in the conversation or persist the roster into a saved summary. Project role, business function, and approval responsibility are three separate things and must not be conflated; none of them implies what evidence someone can access.
- **Boundaries:** `send_project_note` re-checks that the recipient is still an active member at call time and reuses the exact same Project Notes storage/RLS as the human Send Note form -- it cannot address a non-member or a member of a different Project. Confirmation before sending is enforced by prompt guidance, not a code-level gate -- the same trust boundary already accepted for every other Ember tool that creates a record (e.g. `create_project`).
- **Exposure:** Ember-actionable, Project-bound only; never offered in general chat.
- **Verification:** `src/lib/chat/project-members-tool.ts`, `src/lib/chat/project-note-tool.ts`; code verified 2026-08-30. Live-verified: asked "who is working on this project, and who handles commercial approval?" against a real Project and got the correct roster and approval responsibilities; separately asked Ember to send a note, confirmed it drafted content and waited for explicit confirmation before calling `send_project_note`, and the resulting note appeared correctly addressed on the Project's Notes page with a working structured link in the Artifacts panel. Also confirmed a general (unbound) conversation never offers or uses `list_project_members`.

### Manage access and AI-processing sensitivity

- **Intent:** Restrict a source, article, artifact, or the project itself to specific people/groups (human access) and separately control which AI providers may process it (AI-processing sensitivity).
- **Users and authority:** Project owner, or platform admin via the same manage boundary.
- **Prerequisites:** Access to the selected project; owner or admin authority. **Every person or group granted here must already be an active Project member** -- this page cannot add a new person to the project. Add them at the project's **Members** page first if they aren't one yet, then come here to grant them access to a specific restricted resource or the project's own sensitivity tier.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]/access`
- **Navigation:** Project → **Access & Evidence** → classify a listed resource, or set the project's own sensitivity in the **This project** section → select from existing members/groups → save.
- **Outcome:** A resource or the project gains (or changes) a human-access classification, an AI-processing sensitivity tier, or both -- independently. Restricting human access requires granting at least one *existing* group or named member in the same action -- it does not invite anyone. An unclassified resource or project defaults to Internal for AI-processing purposes, never Public.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember does not perform classification itself; it may explain that a blocked response is due to this policy and direct an eligible user to this page. If the user's goal is actually to add a new person to the project (not grant an existing member access to something restricted), direct them to **Members** instead -- this page only grants access among people already on the project. Ember must not name or describe a resource the current user cannot see.
- **Boundaries:** Human access and AI-processing sensitivity are separate axes -- changing one never implies the other. Project membership and resource-level access grants are separate axes too -- this page is the second one, never the first. All classification and grant changes are recorded in an audit log.
- **Exposure:** Not an Ember-actionable tool; administrative page only, reached via navigation guidance.
- **Verification:** `/projects/[id]/access`, `AccessEvidenceManager.tsx`; code verified 2026-08-29. Confirmed as a real, live Ember mistake in the Sandz onboarding experiment's Run 2 (`docs/test-reports/2026-08-30-ember-sandz-onboarding-experiment.md`) -- she read this entry correctly and still told the user to "invite" someone here, because the entry didn't say membership was a prerequisite until this fix.

### See a Project's attached sources and their metadata

- **Intent:** Let any Project member see what's actually in their Project's attached knowledge base(s) -- title, publisher, current version, and source link -- without asking Ember or needing curator/admin access.
- **Users and authority:** Any active member of the Project, not just owner/curator/admin -- RLS on `knowledge_sources` already scopes each source correctly per-viewer, so a restricted source is simply absent from the list rather than specially hidden.
- **Prerequisites:** Active membership in the Project.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]`
- **Navigation:** Project page → Knowledge section → each attached knowledge base lists its sources underneath, each linking to its own `/sources/[id]` detail page.
- **Outcome:** A read-only metadata list -- not the source's actual chunked/embedded content, which stays gated to platform curator/admin at `/review/[docId]`.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember can already answer "what's in the KB" conversationally via `search_project_knowledge`/`search_wiki`; this page gives the same metadata a permanent, browsable home so the user doesn't have to ask every time. No new Ember tool -- point a user here if they want to browse rather than ask.
- **Boundaries:** Never confuse this with the actual chunk/document content, which stays curator/admin-only. Never confuse it with the owner/admin-only Access & Evidence page, which manages classification/grants, not just displays metadata.
- **Exposure:** UI-only; not Ember-actionable (Ember already covers the equivalent conversationally via existing search tools).
- **Verification:** `src/lib/projects/queries.ts` (`listSourcesForKnowledgeBases`), `src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/page.tsx`; code verified 2026-09-04. Live-verified as both a platform admin and a `viewer`-role member with no manage rights against the real Sandz Pilot project -- the list rendered identically for both.

### Submit a candidate source for a Project

- **Intent:** Let an ordinary Project member propose knowledge for their Project -- a file, or an already-approved, content-bearing Ember-generated workstream artifact -- for their curator to decide on, closing the gap where only platform curator/admin could add anything to any knowledge base.
- **Users and authority:** Any active Project member, any Project role (owner/curator/consultant/viewer all qualify -- this is deliberately broader than who *decides* a submission).
- **Prerequisites:** Active membership in the Project. The Project must already have at least one knowledge base attached (Project page → Knowledge section → **Attach a knowledge base**) -- a submission always goes into one of the Project's own attached knowledge bases, chosen by the submitter. For an artifact-kind submission specifically, the artifact must already be `approved` within its own workstream and have inline text content -- a link-only artifact (an external URL with no content) has nothing to submit and will not appear in the picker.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]` (Knowledge section)
- **Navigation:** Project page → Knowledge section → **Submit a source** → choose **File** (upload, optional citation URL) or **Workstream artifact** (pick from the Project's own eligible artifacts) → pick which attached knowledge base it targets → **Submit for review**.
- **Outcome:** A new `pending` submission the Project's owner/curator/admin can see and decide. **Nothing becomes retrievable by Ember at this point** -- submitting is a proposal, not an addition to the knowledge base.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this yet -- it is a UI-only workflow. If a user asks Ember to "add" or "upload" a source to their Project, direct them here rather than attempting it conversationally, and be explicit that a curator/owner still has to approve it before Ember can use it in answers. Never tell a user their submission is already searchable -- it is not, until approved.
- **Boundaries:** A member submitting a file has no path into the platform's curator-only `/upload` worklist and cannot bypass this proposal step. Real URL-fetching (submitting a bare link with no file, expecting the system to scrape it) is not supported -- a URL is only ever an optional citation attached to a file. Rejecting a file-kind submission deletes the underlying (never-approved) document; an artifact-kind submission that's rejected leaves the original workstream artifact untouched.
- **Exposure:** Not Ember-actionable; UI only.
- **Verification:** `src/components/projects/SubmitSourceForm.tsx`, `src/lib/workbench/source-submissions.ts` (`submitFileSource`, `submitArtifactSource`), `supabase/migrations/20260904100001_project_source_submissions.sql`; code verified 2026-09-04. Live-verified: a non-admin Project member (consultant Project role) submitted a real file through this exact flow on a disposable test Project and confirmed it appeared as `pending`, not yet retrievable.

### Review and decide a candidate source

- **Intent:** Let the Project's owner/curator/admin approve or reject a member-submitted source before it enters the Project's knowledge base.
- **Users and authority:** The Project's **owner, curator, or admin** -- the same `can_curate_project` bar as workstream creation and membership management, deliberately not owner-only. A plain member/consultant cannot decide their own or anyone else's submission, even though they can see it if they submitted it.
- **Prerequisites:** Active `owner` or `curator` Project role, or platform `admin`; at least one `pending` submission on the Project.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]` (Knowledge section)
- **Navigation:** Project page → Knowledge section → **Pending sources** list (visible only to an authorized decider) → **Approve** or **Reject** (Reject accepts an optional reason) on the relevant row.
- **Outcome:** **Approve** processes the source for real (parses/chunks a file, or copies an artifact's content into a new document) and embeds every resulting chunk into the Project's knowledge base immediately -- this is the moment the source actually becomes retrievable by Ember, never before. **Reject** discards a file-kind submission's never-approved document entirely (an artifact-kind submission has no document to discard, since its content stays in the original workstream artifact). Approved chunks are auto-approved in bulk rather than needing one-by-one sign-off, but remain individually re-reviewable afterward on the existing curator chunk-review page (`/review/[docId]`) -- a curator or admin can still reject an individual chunk later if it turns out to be wrong.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this -- it is a UI-only decision. If asked "is my submission live yet," the honest answer requires checking this page's status, not assuming approval happened. Never say a submission was auto-approved without a human decision -- the decision itself (who approved it and when) is always recorded.
- **Boundaries:** Only the Project's own owner/curator/admin can decide -- not a platform curator/admin who isn't actually on this Project, and not the submitter themselves acting alone. Approving or rejecting an already-decided submission is a no-op, not an error, to tolerate a race between two deciders.
- **Exposure:** Not Ember-actionable; UI only.
- **Verification:** `src/components/projects/SourceSubmissionsReview.tsx`, `src/lib/workbench/source-submissions.ts` (`approveSourceSubmission`, `rejectSourceSubmission`), reuses `src/lib/curator/chunks.ts` (`approveChunk`) unmodified; code verified 2026-09-04. Live-verified: a project owner approved a real member-submitted file and confirmed the resulting chunk was genuinely embedded (present in `kb_vectors` with the expected auto-approval marker) and separately visible/re-reviewable on `/review/[docId]`.

### Configure a Project's Ember starter prompt

- **Intent:** Give a Project a short, clickable suggestion Ember offers to anyone starting a fresh conversation bound to it -- e.g. "Ask anything about the Sandz pilot, suggest an improvement, or report a problem" for a Q&A-style Project.
- **Users and authority:** The Project's **owner, curator, or admin** -- same `can_curate_project` bar as membership management and source review, not owner-only.
- **Prerequisites:** Active `owner` or `curator` Project role, or platform `admin`.
- **Start:** `/projects/[id]`
- **Navigation:** Project page → **+ Add a starter prompt for Ember** (or **Edit**, if one is already set) → type the prompt → **Save**.
- **Outcome:** The saved text appears as a clickable suggestion in Ember whenever someone opens a *new* conversation bound to this Project -- confirmed to appear for a first-time Ember user, a returning user's "Welcome back" state, and the plain empty-conversation state alike, not just one of them.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember has no dedicated tool for this -- it is a UI-only setting. If a user asks how to change what Ember suggests when someone opens their Project, direct them here.
- **Boundaries:** This only affects the *suggestion chip* shown before a conversation starts -- it is never injected as a hidden instruction or system prompt, and does not change what evidence Ember can retrieve or what it's allowed to say.
- **Exposure:** Not Ember-actionable; UI only.
- **Verification:** `src/components/projects/ProjectStarterPromptForm.tsx`, `src/lib/workbench/projects.ts` (`updateProjectStarterPrompt`), `supabase/migrations/20260904110001_project_starter_prompt.sql`; code verified 2026-09-04. Live-verified on a real Project: set the prompt, confirmed the clickable chip rendered in all three empty-conversation states described above, then cleared it back to unset.

## 4. Wiki

### Find approved guidance

- **Intent:** Locate reusable platform guidance or authorized project knowledge.
- **Users and authority:** Signed-in users; article visibility and project membership determine results.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in session; project membership for private project articles.
- **Start:** `/wiki`
- **Navigation:** Open **Wiki** → search or filter by category, status, or project → select an article.
- **Outcome:** The user sees the approved version and available provenance, relationships, and source links they are authorized to access.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may search approved Wiki content, summarize it with citations, and offer an authorized article link.
- **Boundaries:** Platform admin or curator status does not automatically grant access to approved private customer knowledge. Ember must not reveal the existence, title, excerpt, or source of inaccessible private articles.
- **Exposure:** Ember-readable; strong candidate for MCP read access with visibility enforcement.
- **Verification:** `/wiki`, `/wiki/[slug]`, project visibility controls; code verified 2026-08-28.

### Create or curate Wiki knowledge

- **Intent:** Convert reviewed evidence or manual expertise into governed, reusable guidance.
- **Users and authority:** Curator or admin for authoring and review functions; final approval follows the configured workflow.
- **Prerequisites:** Appropriate role and, for project-private knowledge, an authorized project link.
- **Start:** `/wiki/new` or an editable article at `/wiki/[slug]/edit`.
- **Navigation:** Create or edit draft → attach sources/projects as appropriate → submit/review → approve or return for changes.
- **Outcome:** A versioned Wiki article; approved content becomes retrievable within its visibility boundary.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may explain the workflow and draft content where supported, but must distinguish drafting from approval or publication.
- **Boundaries:** Attach a project before narrowing an article to project-only visibility. Approval and visibility changes are consequential, authority-gated actions.
- **Exposure:** Draft assistance may be Ember-actionable; approval should remain authority-gated and excluded from broad external MCP access.
- **Verification:** Wiki routes and curation components; code verified 2026-08-28.

## 5. Blog

### Draft and submit an article

- **Intent:** Prepare public-facing material based on reviewed ideas without turning KB Sandbox into a full content-management system.
- **Users and authority:** Curator and admin can access `/contribute/blog`; only admin publishes.
- **Prerequisites:** Curator or admin role.
- **Start:** `/contribute/blog`
- **Navigation:** Open **Blog** (`/blog`) → **My drafts** (shown only to curator/admin) → **New draft** → write or import initial content → edit/preview → save → submit for review.
- **Outcome:** A private draft or submitted article. It is not publicly visible until an admin publishes it.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may explain the authoring and review process and navigate eligible users to the contributor area. It must not offer the contributor route to an ineligible user as if access were available.
- **Boundaries:** Contributors cannot edit another author's draft through guessed URLs. Submission locks curator editing until an admin returns the article to draft. Publishing and unpublishing are admin-only.
- **Exposure:** Draft preparation may be Ember-assisted; publishing is authority-gated and not a general MCP action.
- **Verification:** `/contribute/blog` route gate and the `My drafts` link on `/blog`; code verified 2026-08-28. (Until 2026-08-28, the top-nav "Blog" link itself pointed curator/admin straight at `/contribute/blog`'s own-drafts-only view instead of the public listing -- fixed the same day, see the next entry.)

### Read published articles

- **Intent:** Read public articles and share their canonical links.
- **Users and authority:** Anyone -- anonymous visitors and every signed-in role see the identical list of published articles; there is no author-scoped or role-scoped narrowing on this page.
- **Prerequisites:** The article is published.
- **Start:** `/blog`
- **Navigation:** Open **Blog** in the top nav (now unconditional for every signed-in role, not just curator/admin) → select a published article → `/blog/[slug]`.
- **Outcome:** Public article with its approved presentation and metadata.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember may link to a relevant published article as a citation or recommended reading. KB Sandbox navigation links should not be collected as user artifacts merely because Ember used them for navigation.
- **Boundaries:** Draft and unpublished articles return no public content.
- **Exposure:** Public MCP/resource candidate; read-only.
- **Verification:** Public Blog routes; code verified 2026-08-28. Fixed the same day: the top-nav "Blog" link was curator/admin-only and pointed at `/contribute/blog` (an own-drafts-only view), so a signed-in curator/admin saw fewer posts than an anonymous visitor, and a plain consultant had no Blog nav link at all. `Header.tsx`'s Blog link now always points here for every signed-in role; `/contribute/blog` is reached via a "My drafts" button shown only to curator/admin on this page.

## 6. Trending

### Examine and discuss emerging material

- **Intent:** Share external material worth examining before deciding whether it should become governed knowledge.
- **Users and authority:** Signed-in users may view and submit within applicable access rules; curator/admin perform curation actions.
- **Prerequisites:** Signed-in session.
- **Start:** `/trending`
- **Navigation:** Open **Trending** → filter by tag or select an item; choose **Submit to Trending** to add material.
- **Outcome:** External material can be discussed, tagged, associated with a project, reviewed, archived, or promoted into a Wiki draft.
- **Ember guidance:** Ember should describe Trending as an intake and discussion area, not as an authoritative knowledge base. It may navigate to an item the user may access.
- **Boundaries:** A Trending item is not approved evidence merely because it was submitted. Promotion creates or updates a draft and still requires Wiki review/approval.
- **Exposure:** Ember-readable; submission could be a confirmed MCP action. Promotion and moderation are authority-gated.
- **Verification:** Trending routes and curation actions; code verified 2026-08-28.

## 7. Explore

### Evals

- **Intent:** Measure model, retrieval, or workflow quality using repeatable datasets and runs.
- **Start:** `/evals`
- **Navigation:** Explore → **Evals**.
- **Ember guidance:** Explain available evaluation concepts and direct the user to the relevant dataset or run only when authorized.
- **Exposure:** Results are candidates for read access; creating or running evaluations requires scoped controls.
- **Verification:** Header and evaluation routes; code verified 2026-08-28. Detailed workflows remain to be catalogued.

### Graphs

- **Intent:** Inspect how bounded agents, tools, deterministic operations, evidence, guardrails, and human gates are connected.
- **Start:** `/graphs`
- **Navigation:** Explore → **Graphs** → select a graph.
- **Ember guidance:** Explain that a visualization describes a flow; it does not by itself authorize execution or prove that every node is an AI agent.
- **Exposure:** Read-only visualization candidate.
- **Verification:** Header and graph routes; code verified 2026-08-28. Detailed workflows remain to be catalogued.

### Agents

- **Intent:** Discover and use available KB Sandbox agents.
- **Start:** `/agents`
- **Navigation:** Explore → **Agents** → select an agent; Ember has a dedicated entry at `/agents/workbench-assistant`.
- **Ember guidance:** Distinguish KB Sandbox-native agents from external registered agents and from Workbench Methods.
- **Exposure:** Agent metadata may be readable; execution requires each agent's own tool, data, identity, and confirmation controls.
- **Verification:** Header and agent routes; code verified 2026-08-28. Detailed workflows remain to be catalogued.

### Agent Registry (external)

- **Intent:** Record and inspect externally implemented agents as governed, versioned specifications.
- **Users and authority:** Signed-in non-anonymous users, subject to registry controls.
- **Start:** `/agent-registry`
- **Navigation:** Explore → **Agent Registry (external)**.
- **Ember guidance:** Clarify that registration or visualization does not mean the external agent is hosted by, trusted by, or executable through KB Sandbox.
- **Exposure:** Registry metadata is a candidate for controlled read access; external invocation is separately designed and authorized.
- **Verification:** Header and registry routes; code verified 2026-08-28. Detailed workflows remain to be catalogued.

## Ember response contract for navigation

When a user asks where or how to do something, Ember should return:

1. a one-sentence answer identifying the appropriate area;
2. any prerequisite, project binding, membership, or role requirement;
3. one primary stable navigation link;
4. a short description of what the user will do or see next;
5. an explicit distinction between navigation, drafting, execution, approval, and publication; and
6. an honest limitation when the workflow is unverified or not yet supported.

Example:

> Use **Projects** to open the customer workspace, then choose **Ask Assistant about this project** so I can use its authorized sources. You must be a member of that project. [Open Projects](/projects)

Ember should avoid:

- listing several weakly related links when one primary route is sufficient;
- inventing a route or using a test-specific identifier;
- treating a link click as completion of the linked action;
- implying that admin, curator, or project membership grants an authority that has not been verified;
- putting internal KB Sandbox navigation links in the user's Artifacts collection; and
- exposing private content through link labels, summaries, citations, or error messages.

## Update checklist

For every material UI or workflow change:

1. update the affected catalogue entry in the same code change;
2. verify the shortest path as each affected role or project relationship;
3. check empty, populated, pending, approved, and denied states where relevant;
4. update Ember's committed navigation knowledge;
5. add or update link/route checks;
6. add a concise release note linking to the catalogue heading; and
7. record the verification date and evidence without including secrets or customer-sensitive data.

## Discovery backlog

The following areas need deeper workflow-level verification in later passes:

- project creation, membership, access, and approval-authority management;
- source upload, document versioning, review, and publication;
- project knowledge-base and Wiki attachment/reuse;
- project-bound Ember conversations, artifacts, and recovery;
- assessments, datasets, evaluation runs, and result approval;
- agent graph and external registry detail views;
- profile, journals, and feedback/problem reporting;
- owner Roadmap access and export; and
- admin-only provider, model, Blog publication, and system-management workflows.

These entries should be expanded before they are treated as complete MCP discovery evidence.
